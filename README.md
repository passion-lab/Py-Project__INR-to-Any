# Py-Project__INR-to-Any
A simple yet updated version of currency converter written in Python that converts any amount of Indian rupees (INR) to the currency of any country. Latest database receives from the X-Rates website and updates to the local database with timestamp. Then the program uses that local database to convert currency. If any issues occur during updating the local database from the X-Rates website, then the program uses the last updated local database to do the same task by warning the user about using the previously updated database.
